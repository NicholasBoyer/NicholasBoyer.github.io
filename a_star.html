                    <h2>Description</h2>
                    <p>In the winter term of 2023, I created a pathfinding program using machine learning. Since then, I've altered the program to use the well-known and efficient A* algorithm.</p>

                    <h2>Justification</h2>
                    <p>Pathfinding algorithms are challenging to implement. They take a high degree of technical knowledge and practical programming skill, so I knew updating my pathfinding program would make a great addition to my ePortfolio. In completing this artifact, I had to learn an entirely new algorithm to solve the common problem of finding an efficient path from point A to B. This artifact highlights my abilities by virtue of its complexity. Implementing this algorithm involved many sub-algorithms and data structures, such as using a priority queue to search through positions and backtracking to produce the resulting path. I believe this artifact showcases the best of my skills and I am proud of my work.</p>

                    <h2>Reflection</h2>
                    <p>Reflecting on the process of enhancing and modifying this artifact, I learned a great deal about the practical application of algorithms and how theoretical knowledge can be applied to solve real-world problems. Implementing the A* algorithm required me to deepen my understanding of data structures, particularly priority queues as implemented by heaps, which are crucial for maintaining search frontiers. I also learned the importance of working iteratively and making sure to test my program often. I reduced the frequency of program revisions by working on small chunks of code at a time. Overall, this experience not only improved my technical skills but also reinforced the importance of perseverance and problem-solving in software development.</p>
