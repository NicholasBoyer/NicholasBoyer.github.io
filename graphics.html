                    <h2>Description</h2>
                    <p>In the summer term of 2023, I created a 3D graphics program in C++ with OpenGL. Later, I ported the program to Python with VPython driving the graphics functionality.</p>

                    <h2>Justification</h2>
                    <p>By including this program, I intend to showcase my proficiency in multiple programming languages and my capacity to effectively utilize 3D graphics. The graphics program was originally written in C++ using the OpenGL and GLEW libraries, and was later ported to Python with VPython servicing graphics display and user input. All necessary components, such as 3D objects, lighting, camera controls, and textures were reimplemented in the port. Numerous elements of the program were improved in the porting process, including smoother camera movement and the addition of 3D animations. The improvements were demanding and presented me with a steep learning curve. With the wide usage of 3D graphics in various application domains, such as medical diagnostics, education, and video games, it appeared sensible and advantageous to showcase my 3D graphics capabilities.</p>

                    <h2>Reflection</h2>
                    <p>While enhancing my artifact to a higher level of quality, I encountered numerous obstacles, each presenting a challenge to overcome. Before embarking on the enhancement, I had no experience with 3D graphics in Python. My inexperience necessitated that I learn a new Python library, which was a considerable task. In addition to adhering to best practices regarding programming, commenting, and formatting, I was required to familiarize myself with a myriad of new function calls and object definitions. It took patience and reliance on problem-solving fundamentals to finish my enhancement. I feel that by overcoming these challenges, I have matured my learning in the specific field of Python graphics and in the more general field of problem solving and software engineering.</p>
