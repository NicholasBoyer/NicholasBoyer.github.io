                    <h2>Description</h2>
                    <p>In the spring term of 2024, I developed a full stack website using MongoDB, Express.js, Angular, and Node.js. In addition to the MEAN technologies, Handlebars is used for templating and dynamic display of data.</p>

                    <h2>Justification</h2>
                    <p>MEAN is one of the most common stacks used in web development. The sheer practical utility of the technology strengthens its claim to inclusion in my ePortfolio. My enhancements required much troubleshooting to use and manipulate the various technologies which make up the website, which, in addition to the stack components, include Handlebars for templating and MongoDB Compass for database troubleshooting. I extended the functionality of the database by storing meal plans with MongoDB and accessing them through an API gateway. These meal plans were used to dynamically display information on the Meals page such that editing the meal plan data required no extra work for the developer beyond modifying meal data.</p>

                    <h2>Reflection</h2>
                    <p>Enhancing and modifying my MEAN website was an invaluable learning experience. Throughout the process, I learned how to effectively manage data using MongoDB and create a RESTful API to handle dynamic content updates. One significant challenge was ensuring that the API returned the correct data, as opposed to returning a 404 error. I also overcame challenges involved in designing a compact, logical data schema. These challenges taught me the importance of proactive design and iterative working. Overall, I feel the experience honed my skills in database management and more broadly enhanced my web development capabilities.</p>
