                    <h2>Assessing My Strengths</h2>
                    <p>When I first began my journey in higher education, I was ambitious yet inexperienced. I had aspirations to create software to finish my personal tasks and to create websites where I could post and share my accumulated knowledge. However, as I had never taken a course on application software development or web development at that point, I lacked the technical knowledge to achieve my goals. Now, finally at the cusp of earning my undergraduate degree in computer science, I have proven my capacity to learn and to apply new knowledge in the computing field. I have developed the toolset needed to be an effective and dynamic software engineer.</p>
                    <p>Creating my ePortfolio was among the most enriching experiences of my education. In the course of revisiting my earlier work, I realized the extent of my growth as a software developer. As I reviewed the code I had earlier written, the potential for improvement was glaring to my eyes. Subsequently, it natural to apply the coding standards and best practices that I had learned in lecture and in readings. I enjoyed the process and found it rewarding. As with all things in life, creating the ePortfolio was a learning activity, so in the process of its creation, I not only was able to apply knowledge I had learned in my previous course, but I also had to learn new frameworks and algorithms, such as VPython and A*.</p>
                    <p>I strongly believe that my ePortfolio showcases the best of my work and highlights my strengths as a computer scientist. My computer graphics program enhancement highlights my dynamism and flexibility as a programmer by demonstrating my ability to use 3D graphics in multiple languages and with multiple libraries. My pathfinding program enhancement highlights my breadth of knowledge in algorithms and my ability to learn and apply new algorithms as needed. My MEAN website demonstrates my proficiency in database management as well as web security by its handling of user authentication. Altogether, my ePortfolio proves my competency as a versatile and dedicated software engineer.

                    <h2>Artifact Cohesion</h2>
                    <p>My ePortfolio consists of three artifacts. The first of the artifacts is the graphics program, which was ported to Python with the VPython library driving the graphics functionality. The second artifact is the pathfinding program, which initially used machine learning and has since been augmented with the A* algorithm to find the shortest path between two points on a grid. The last of my artifacts is the MEAN website, which was improved by using MongoDB, API gateways, and Handlebars to dynamically display meal plans. The artifacts were chosen to showcase my expertise in a variety of programming languages and areas of interest, such as web security, algorithmic efficiency, and database proficiency.</p>
                    <p>My artifacts cover many bases while highlighting my specialization in software development. Individually, my graphics artifact highlights my ability to make practical decisions in software engineering, my pathfinding artifact underlines my algorithmic knowledge, and my MEAN website shows my database fluency. Collectively, they demonstrate my specialization in application software. Each program is intended to run on a consumer grade computer and service a desktop user, and the languages and techniques employed in each artifact are also often employed in desktop applications. Given the large and growing market for application software, my ePortfolio demonstrates my proficiency in a popular market while also preparing me for entry into that market.
